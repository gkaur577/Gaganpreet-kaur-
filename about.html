    <p class="para">
      Hi! My name is Gaganpreet Kaur, and I am a student of Seneca College at Markham Campus. I am
      writing this submission as a part of my Web222 Assignment.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
      I moved to Canada 8 months ago for pursuing my studies in Computer Programming, and I am
      enjoying it so far. My fellow classmates at Seneca have been extremely friendly, and my
      professors have been very understanding and helful. I am living the dream right now.
    </p>
    <p class="para">
      However, my studies are a small step in my major career plan. I intend to be a software
      engineer at Google one day. I am well aware that I need to work hard to accomplish that, I am
      working on it right now. My this year's resolution contains some serious careers goals, and I
      intend to complete them before December 31, with the help from my peers, and my professors.
    </p>
    <p class="para">Thank you.</p>
